# Iconified

“ICONIFIED”, runs on android smartphones and tablets. This proposed system allows user to get information about logo and icons of companies that he doesn’t know. 

## Description

The project isdesigned to give straightforward sample of using TensorFlow in mobile applications.

TensorFlow is a multipurpose machine learning framework. TensorFlow can be used anywhere from training huge models across clusters in the cloud, to running models locally on an embedded system like your phone.

A device running API 18 or higher is required to run the demo due to the use of the camerakit API.

## Training Model:

[TensorFlow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0):
        In this codelab, you will learn how to run TensorFlow on a single machine, and will train a simple classifier to classify images.

## Running this Application

Replace "graph.pb" "labels.txt" in assets folder by your generated "retrained_graph.pb" and "retrained_labels.txt"
